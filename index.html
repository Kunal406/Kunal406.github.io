<p>Colours play an important role in the festival of Holi. They add vitality to the festival,making it one of the most vibrant of celebrations. Each of the colours is deemed to have a symbolic significance. Blue for instance is the colour of Krishna's complexion and also of the sky and the oceans.
And colours are the smiles of nature.<mark>Birds are beautiful jewels in the sky.</mark> There are many brightly coloured birds in the world, and the most flamboyant ones are the parrots. During our birding sojourn in Australia, Ahalya and myself saw some of the most multihued parrots, prominent among them being the Rainbow Lorikeet.</p>
<p>Rainbow Lorikeet, definitely deserves its name! True to its name, one can see all the colour palettes of rainbow in its feathers. Its head is deep blue with a greenish-yellow nuchal collar, and the rest of the upper parts (wings, back, and tail) are green. The chest is orange/yellow in colour. The belly is deep blue, and the thighs and rump are green. Their species name, haematodus, comes from the Latin word for blood, and is a reference to the rich red found on its breast.The colour of the feathers of birds serves various functions; thermoregulation, climatic adaptation and a fine balance between sexual signalling and camouflage. Birds need to balance being attractive to potential mates while having some kind of camouflage against potential predators. When hunted from above, the Rainbow Lorikeet blends with the foliage of the trees with its green back. It has been suggested that the colourful patches confer evolutionary advantage in courtship and mate recognition.</p>
<p>Rainbow lorikeets have two unique features. They possess a tongue with brush-type tissues helping them to collect nectar and pollen. The other distinctive feature is their agile legs which help them to hang upside-down and feed on bottlebrush flowers. It is a dazzling sight when flocks of them fly with the rays of the sun streaming through their gorgeous plumage!</p>

<h1 style="color:Pink;"><ins>World Fastest Bird Peregrine Falcon</ins></h1>
<img src="falcon.webp" alt="Peregrine Falcon" style="Float:right; width:700; height:300;">
<p>Powerful and fast-flying, the Peregrine Falcon hunts medium-sized birds, dropping down on them from high above in a spectacular stoop. They were virtually eradicated from eastern North America by pesticide poisoning in the middle 20th century. After significant recovery efforts, Peregrine Falcons have made an incredible rebound and are now regularly seen in many large cities and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Sleek, fast-flying large falcon. Always look for a grayish back in adults, long wings that almost reach the tail tip, and powerful but slender build. Dark mark below each eye varies in shape and size. Juveniles are more heavily patterned below than adults, and can be quite brownish above. </p>
<p>Patterning varies considerably across a wide global range, with back color ranging from pale gray in Central Asian “Red-capped” to slaty-blue across much of northern Eurasia North America, to almost black in Asian “Shaheen.” Chases prey down at high speeds with continuous powerful wingbeats. Becoming increasingly common in parts of range, especially in cities, where they can nest on tall buildings and feed on pigeons. Adaptable, and can be seen in a wide range of habitats; often encountered in areas with steep cliffs, as well as around coastal mudf-lats and open areas with shorebirds.</p>

<h1 style="color:green;"><ins>Best Voice Bird Nightingale</ins></h1>
<img src="Nightingale.jpg" alt="Nightingale" style="float:right; width:550px; height650px">
<p>I'm going to be exploring the wonderful world of bird song (with calls thrown in for good measure!) There's surely little more calming to human ears than the annual serenade of spring song. Each day, prior to the sun's appearance above the horizon, birds begin to advertise their presence, demonstrating their strength and ability in song. This serves not only to attract a mate but also to deter rivals. As you wake in the morning, during these times of increased isolation, take a moment to notice the birds who break the morning silence, the Robin, the Blackbird and perhaps the Song Thrush. Enjoy the chorus as it widens, as Wren, Starling, Chaffinch and Dunnock join in. The complexities of bird song may not be easy to get to grips with, but why not take the time to learn. The satisfaction to be gained from identifying birds by song (and calls) really can't be overemphasised - it's truly a window into another world.</p>
<p>Next up, the glorious Nightingale, a bird with a reputation for song like no other. There are probably very few species with a more prodigious claim to world's greatest songster, certainly not if based purely upon cultural connotations. The song of the Nightingale has been famously celebrated for thousands of years, by writers, poets and musicians all across Europe. The vociferous song is of course in complete opposition to their observability. In Britain at least, the Nightingale is a skulking bird of the understory. In all honestly, most may feel relatively disappointed at the sight of a Nightingale for it is, in essence, a plain Robin-lookalike without the fancy breast. Their posture is markedly different and they do display a rich russet rump and conspicuous white throat, but it rarely seems relevant for few get the chance to see one for long. If anything, their visibility seems barely to matter for the song comprehensively 'outguns' the visual appearance of the bird. People may travel far and wide to hear a Nightingale, quite content to listen to its melodic tones and nothing more. In fact, this isn't a recent thing for the Victorians were exceedingly keen to do so. Unfortunately, during these times of extensive 'collecting', many were not content to listen purely in the wild.</p>

<h1 style="color:Purple;"><ins>World Best Predator & Killer Birds</ins></h1>
<h2 style="color:Yellow;">Golden Eagle</h2>
<img src="Golden Eagle.jpg" alt="Golden Eagle" style="Float:Right; width:350px  height:450px">
<p>The Golden Eagle is one of the largest, fastest, nimblest raptors in North America. Lustrous gold feathers gleam on the back of its head and neck; a powerful beak and talons advertise its hunting prowess. You're most likely to see this eagle in western North America, soaring on steady wings or diving in pursuit of the jackrabbits and other small mammals that are its main prey. Sometimes seen attacking large mammals, or fighting off coyotes or bears in defense of its prey and young, the Golden Eagle has long inspired both reverence and fear.</p>
<p>Although capable of killing large prey such as cranes, wild ungulates, and domestic livestock, the Golden Eagle subsists primarily on rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, and prairie dogs.The Golden Eagle is the most common official national animal in the world—it's the emblem of Albania, Germany, Austria, Mexico, and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The amount of white in the wings of a young Golden Eagle varies among individuals, and a few lack white in the wings entirely.</p>
<p>Biologists, engineers, and government officials have cooperated in developing and publicizing power-pole designs that reduce raptor electrocutions—caused when the large birds' wings or feet accidentally touch two lines and form a circuit. Since the early 1970s, utility companies have modified poles to prevent eagle electrocutions. And some new power lines in nonurban areas have been built to <q>raptor-safe</q> construction standards.</p>
<p><q>Hacking,</q> an age-old falconry technique, is helping rebuild Golden Eagle populations. Humans feed caged, lab-reared nestlings at a nestlike hack site until the birds reach 12 weeks old, when the cage is opened and they begin feeding themselves. The fledglings continue to receive handouts from their hack-site caretakers for several weeks, until they gain full independence in the wild.</p>

<h2 style="color:Orange;">Harpy Eagle</h2>
<img src="Harpy.jpg" alt="Harpy Eagle" style="Float:Right; width:450  height:550">
<p>Today, more and more people are moving into forested areas and many natural resources, like trees and minerals, are increasingly in demand. As a result, it is becoming harder for many wildlife species, including Harpy Eagles, to find good areas in which to live. In Central America, the loss of Harpy Eagles was particularly noticed as the species became extinct in countries such as El Salvador and began disappearing quickly from others.</p>
<p>In 1989 The Peregrine Fund began a program to learn how to breed Harpy Eagles in captivity and to return the species to some of its rainforest habitat. With the cooperation of many Latin American countries such as Panama, Ecuador and Venezuela, which donated eagles from their national zoos and similar facilities, The Peregrine Fund had enough Harpy Eagles to begin a captive breeding program. The adult eagles were all sent to The Peregrine Fund’s headquarters in Boise, Idaho.</p>
<p>Boise is much colder and drier than the places where most Harpy Eagles live. To help make the birds feel at home and thus more likely to breed, The Peregrine Fund built special chambers designed to mimic some of the conditions of a natural rain forest. Despite these efforts, however, only 10 Harpy Eagle chicks survived to hatching in about seven years.</p>
<p>Our biologists realized that to achieve the highest production possible, the eagles needed to be in an area more consistent with their natural habitat, which would include an outdoor area with warmer temperatures, higher humidity, and adequate sunlight. The commitment to creating a more productive captive population of Harpy Eagles was realized with the construction of the Neotropical Raptor Center and breeding facility in Panama City, Panama, in 2001. At the new facility, 17 eagles hatched in the first year alone!</p>
<P><b>Almost 50 Harpy Eagles have been released in Panama and Belize since 1998.</b>The captive breeding phase ended in 2006 and the last captive birds were released in 2008. Through this effort, The Peregrine Fund gained valuable knowledge and experience that will be useful in ensuring the survival of this and other large, tropical forest raptors.</P>
<p>While the release program was in full swing, The Peregrine Fund also carried out an extensive education campaign designed to teach people that Harpy Eagles are not dangerous and that they should be protected. Peregrine Fund educators conducted talks at schools and in communities, held teacher training workshops, produced radio messages and commercial jingles, and hosted festivals. All of this helped to change people attitudes toward this beautiful eagle. With some help from us, the country of Panama declared the Harpy Eagle as its national bird on April 10, 2002!</p>
<p>A big part of The Peregrine Fund’s education campaign was made possible due to a Harpy Eagle named Luigi. Luigi hatched in Boise and traveled to schools and communities in Panama. He helped teach people that Harpy Eagles are gentle birds and deserve to be protected. Luigi retired in 2013 and moved to Florida.</p>
